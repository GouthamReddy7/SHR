When professionals talk about industries, they are referring to a broad group of companies that operate in the same general space. For example, business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), energy and healthcare are all well-established industries that represent the breadth of the term. An industry vertical, however, is more specific and describes a group of companies that focus on a shared niche or specialized market spanning multiple industries. Also called vertical markets, industry verticals include everything from 3D printing to eSports.
