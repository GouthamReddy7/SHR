# SHR USING ABE AND BLOCKCHAIN
The healthcare industry is facing an increasing challenge when it comes to securing and authenticating health records. With the rise of electronic health records (EHRs) and other digital health technologies, there is a growing need to ensure that sensitive patient information is protected from unauthorized access and cyber threats. One of the major challenges associated with securing and authenticating health records is the complexity of the healthcare ecosystem. Health records are often shared among multiple providers, payers, and other stakeholders, each with their own unique systems and processes. This fragmentation can make it difficult to establish a consistent, standardized approach to data security and authentication, leaving patient information vulnerable to breaches and other forms of cyberattacks.
